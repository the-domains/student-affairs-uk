# Hello, world

Hello, I'm JD and welcome to my blog about all things Student Affairs in HE.

This is my corner of the internet to put down my thoughts and opinions on student affairs/life/services/support in UK higher education_._

Much of what I post will be my own thoughts and opinions but I'll also be posting links to articles, videos, podcasts etc... that I think are quite interesting, add to any of my posts or link to student affairs.  
Also it's a new site it will no doubt change in look and feel over the next few months so consider it a beta with new features added as I go along, but for now thanks for coming over to my corner of the internet and if you have any questions or comments (comments section will be coming soon-_ish_) then feel free to [tweet me][0].
