# Hello, world

Welcome to my blog about all things Higher Education.

This is going to be a place for me to put down my thoughts about the world of HE with particular focus on students and their experience but no topic is off limits if it piques my interest along my journey of _[wonk][0]-_iness_._

Hopefully I will post, somewhat regularly and when things are just based on my opinion I will try and back things up with evidence (being a good _part-time _student and all)

Along with evidence I will also back up my thoughts with GIFs because when you run out of things to say or you can't explain your frustration with something (_\*cough\*_ TEF _\*cough\*_) a GIF of a grumpy cat will have to do.

Also it's a new site it will no doubt change in look and feel over the next few months so consider it a beta with new features added as I go along, but for now thanks for coming over to my corner of the internet and if you have any questions or comments (comments section will be coming soon-ish) then feel free to [tweet me][1] or send me an email (jonathan.a.dempsey@gmail.com)
