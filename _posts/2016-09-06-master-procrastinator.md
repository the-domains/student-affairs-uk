# The Master Procrastinator

The new academic year is underway and many headlines about students are about their mental health and rightly so. It is severely under-funded and probably not robust enough for students - there is a lot of pressure on them these days to succeed whilst under pressures of money, home, life etc...   
Often it is said that students aren't _resilient _enough but what does a resilient student look like?

My blog is aimed at looking at many things that make up student affairs in the UK and currently mental health is one of the major talking points. There has been lots of media ([A][0], [B][1], [C][2] and many more) n student mental health, and the relatively recent launch of [Unite's][3] annual Insight Report titled [Student Resilience][4] and how it links with student retention rates. This got me thinking about the whole idea of what we expect resiliency to look like.

### Resilience

A quick google on the definition of resilience and one of the first definitions is

> the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness

The Unite report defines resilience as

> what enables an individual to cope better with adverse circumstances or incidents, including innate factors such as self-management and emotional stability and interpersonal relationships and support networks

An [article][5] on the Guardian website's [Higher Education Network][6] discussed how resilience is a catch-all term used across the spectrum in university life from academics to fellow support staff that students these days aren't resilient and that we as university staff should teach a "_set of skills that help students bounce back from setbacks in life and academia_" and also that resilience should not be linked when discussing mental health.

The question I want to raise though is - _is resilience the concept we want to use?_

It's often talked about in universities, our students need to be more resilient.   
Whether that is with regards to their grades, challenging lectures, growing debt amongst many other issues students have to deal with.

Psychologically speaking, resilience is actually a poorly defined concept which has been hindered by a lack of a unified methodology (1). So applying this to a university context may be difficult. Are we all talking about the same thing when talking about being resilient? Maybe another concept to go along with resilience or at least to re-frame the conversation is needed.

### Psychological Flexibility

I would like to suggest a term that may not be recognisable to many outside of psychology - _psychological flexibility_.  
Indeed this term wasn't familiar to me, but you quickly learn lots of new things when your partner is a health psychology post doc and needs a guinea pig for practicing her presentations on.

The idea of psychological flexibility comes from a form of _[CBT][7]_ known as _ACT _(Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and can be defined as the degree to which a person:

1. Adapts to fluctuating situational demands.
2. Approaches difficult thoughts, feelings, and even physical sensations with a sense of openness and compassion.
3. Adopts a perspective of mindfully focusing on the present moment.
4. Connects with their values--the things that truly matter to them in life.
5. Balances competing desires, needs, and life domains.

### So, in a nutshell, what does it mean to be "psychologically flexible"?

Psychological flexibility can be summarized as behaving in ways that are "**open, aware, and engaged**". It's about being compassionate to yourself and others and being _open_ to inner experiences, even if those experiences are difficult. Being _**aware **_and noticing as those experiences come and go in each moment, and being _**engaged **_by moving towards what truly matters to you and taking steps towards these values.

A good talk about psychological flexibility can be [seen here][8] by [Steven Hayes][9]

The idea of psychological flexibility is not new and has been used in health and wellbeing in such areas as anxiety and chronic pain.

Importantly, the qualities of psychological flexibility may be useful for understanding how people manage the challenges of student life, including:

1. Grappling with challenging new academic material and meeting deadlines.
2. Adapting to the transition to adulthood, including managing finances, eating healthily, living with flatmates, new relationships.
3. Identifying and potentially committing to a career path
4. Finding balance between all of the above.

### Procrastination

Now the title of this blog, in case you forgot, is _Master Procrastinator, _and you may have wondered as you started reading, why that title? Did I make mistake? or was it a sly dig at students just being "lazy"?

Well, it turns out that psychological flexibility might be a useful concept when trying to understand a key challenge faced by some of our students.  
Procrastination, when talking about psychological flexibility, is about a lot more than being "lazy".

Procrastination can be defined as:

> voluntary delay of an intended course of action despite expecting negative consequences because of delay

(2, 3, 4 )

There is a strong link between procrastination and _academic performance_, _retention _and _negative emotions_ such as stress, lower self-esteem, interpersonal conflicts and even an increase in the risk of health problems as shown in a recent article by Gagnon, Dionne and Pychyl (5).  
These are very much like the issues raised in the Unite Insight report around [retention ][10]and [life satisfaction][11].

For many students maintaining good balance between in their personal and academic lives can be difficult. Completing assignments and preparing for exams can stir up difficult thoughts and feelings such as "am I smart enough?"; "what if I fail?".  
Procrastination can serve to, in the short term, avoid these feelings but may ultimately increase them in the long run.  
Students not only want a good academic life but also personal life the values of both can often compete with each other but when the former value may suffer and procrastination may be the result .

Procrastinators may well be seen as psychologically _inflexible _(ibid), and be less likely to seek support, much like those students from the insight report that have lower levels of retention.

Now, often at universities the solution to procrastination comes in the form of time management strategies similar to the [Open University's tips][12] of setting time-based goals, making deals with yourself - "_Okay, I'll go to the pub with my friend tonight, but this means that I'll need to get up early on Sunday to study instead " - _but there is little evidence that strategies like this decrease procrastination (6).

Indeed that deal The Open University says to make with yourself is pretty much a perfect example of the above definition of procrastination and furthermore does not provide students with strategies to deal with the difficult thoughts and feelings that come with procrastination.

### So how can we support students to become more (psychologically) flexible?

Earlier in this piece I mentioned ACT - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - when defining psychological flexibility and seeing as that's where it came from it may well be useful to look at how ACT can help out.

ACT is very much about being open about to an experience no matter how difficult it is and starting a new journey at university can be very difficult, as Unite's report shows. (A good non-technical overview of ACT can be found [here][13])  
ACT is not about trying to get rid of an issue (and yes I know we in student affairs often like to be problem solvers) but helping a person to avoid less the issues they are having. This could very well be putting off (or procrastinating) seeking help or even just wanting a solution to their problem.   
How often have you had students return to you with the same issue over and over again. Every time you have solved their problem they have "bounced back" but the issue never actually seems to be dealt with.   
This is what ACT hopes to help with, moving from a goals/solution focused to being values focused.

A good use of _ACT _used in a university context can be seen at [Exeter Uni][14] who have a [program][15] based upon the work by Australian Uni [RMIT][16] and their audio e-learning program called [6 ACT Conversations][17].  
Exeter's programs aims to support students with the following:

* Overcoming procrastination and completing study tasks
* Starting and sustaining enjoyable relationships with your peers and friends
* Discovering your valued and meaningful life while studying at University
* Living a balanced and enjoyable life

This all flows back in to Unite's report and also what we, as student affairs professionals, want for our students.

### Conclusion

University life can be tough and there will often be times that students face difficulties and those of us working to support students need to let them know that it's okay. There will be tough times, but maybe we should refrain from saying you should "you will bounce back", but focus more on giving students the tools to adapt to situation and find balance in their life rather than sorting out their problems and bouncing back until the next time there is an issue.   
This post is not to say psychological flexibility and ideas from ACT are the only tools a student needs, but one amongst many (including resilience) that we should be able to support them with.
