# The Master Procrastinator

The new academic year is underway and many headlines about students are about their mental health and rightly so. Mental health in HE is severely under-funded and our resources probably not robust enough for the increasing number of students in need. There is a lot of pressure these days to succeed whilst under pressures of money, home, life etc...

Often it is said that students aren't _resilient _enough but what does a resilient student look like?

My blog is aimed at looking at many things that make up student affairs in the UK and currently mental health is one of the major talking points. There has been lots of media ([A][0], [B][1], [C][2] and many more) on student mental health, and the relatively recent launch of [Unite's][3] annual Insight Report titled [Student Resilience][4] touches on this and how it links with student retention rates. This got me thinking about the whole idea of what we expect a resilient student to look like.

### Resilience

A quick google on the definition of resilience and one of the first definitions is

> the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; toughness

The Unite report defines resilience as

> what enables an individual to cope better with adverse circumstances or incidents, including innate factors such as self-management and emotional stability and interpersonal relationships and support networks

An [article][5] on the Guardian website's [Higher Education Network][6] discussed how resilience is a catch-all term used across the spectrum in university life from academics to fellow support staff that students these days aren't resilient and that we as university staff should teach a "_set of skills that help students bounce back from setbacks in life and academia_" and also that resilience should not be linked when discussing mental health.

The question I want to raise though is - _is resilience the concept we want to use?_

It's often talked about in universities, that our students need to be more resilient.   
Whether that is with regards to their grades, challenging lectures, growing debt amongst many other issues students have to deal with.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33675dfb-a028-4aaf-9dc6-46e609cd08f3.gif)

Psychologically speaking, resilience is actually a poorly defined concept which has been hindered by a lack of a unified methodology (1). So applying this to a university context may be difficult. Are we all talking about the same thing when talking about being resilient? Maybe another concept to go along with resilience or at least to re-frame the conversation is needed.

### Psychological Flexibility

I would like to suggest a term that may not be recognisable to many outside of psychology - _psychological flexibility_. Indeed, this term wasn't familiar to me, but you quickly learn lots of new things when your partner is a health psychology post doc and needs a guinea pig for practicing her presentations on.

The idea of psychological flexibility comes from a form of _[CBT][7]_ known as _ACT _(Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and can be defined as the degree to which a person:

1. Adapts to fluctuating situational demands.
2. Approaches difficult thoughts, feelings, and even physical sensations with a sense of openness and compassion.
3. Adopts a perspective of mindfully focusing on the present moment.
4. Connects with their values--the things that truly matter to them in life.
5. Pursues valued goals by balancing competing desires, needs, and life domains.

### So, in a nutshell, what does it mean to be "psychologically flexible"?

Psychological flexibility can be summarised as behaving in ways that are "**open, aware, and engaged**". It's about being compassionate to yourself and others and being _open_ to inner experiences, even if those experiences are difficult. Being _**aware **_and noticing as those experiences come and go in each moment, and being _**engaged **_by moving towards what truly matters to you and taking steps towards these values.

The idea of psychological flexibility is not new and has been used in health and wellbeing in such areas as anxiety and chronic pain.

Importantly, the qualities of psychological flexibility may be useful for understanding how people manage the challenges of student life, including:

1. Grappling with challenging new academic material and meeting deadlines.
2. Adapting to the transition to adulthood, including managing finances, eating healthily, living with flatmates, and fostering new relationships.
3. Identifying and potentially committing to a career path
4. Finding balance between all of the above.

### Procrastination

Now the title of this blog, in case you forgot, is _Master Procrastinator. _  
_Y_ou may have wondered as you started reading, why that title? Did I make mistake? or was it a sly dig at students just being "lazy"?

Well, it turns out that psychological flexibility might be a useful concept when trying to understand a key challenge faced by some of our students.  
Procrastination, when talking about psychological flexibility, is about a lot more than being "lazy".

Procrastination can be defined as:

> voluntary delay of an intended course of action despite expecting negative consequences because of delay

(2, 3, 4 )

There is a strong link between procrastination and _academic performance_, _retention _and _negative emotions_ such as stress, lower self-esteem, interpersonal conflicts and even an increase in the risk of health problems as shown in a recent article by Gagnon, Dionne and Pychyl (5). These are very much like the issues raised in the Unite Insight report around [retention ][8]and [life satisfaction][9].

For many students maintaining good balance between their personal and academic lives can be difficult. Completing assignments and preparing for exams can stir up difficult thoughts and feelings such as "am I smart enough?" and "what if I fail?". In the short term, procrastination can serve to avoid these thoughts and feelings, but may ultimately increase them in the long run. Additionally, students want both a good academic life and personal life and these values can often compete with each other. When the former takes precedence over the latter this may lead to procrastination.

Procrastinators may well be seen as behaving in a psychologically _inflexible _(ibid) way, and may be less likely to seek support---much like those students from the insight report that have lower levels of retention.

Now, often at universities the solution to procrastination comes in the form of time management strategies similar to these [Open University's tips][10] of setting time-based goals, and making deals with yourself, such as saying- "_Okay, I'll go to the pub with my friend tonight, but this means that I'll need to get up early on Sunday to study instead " - _but there is little evidence that strategies like this decrease procrastination (6).

Indeed that deal The Open University says to make with yourself is pretty much a perfect example of the above definition of procrastination. Furthermore, this approach does not provide students with strategies to deal with the difficult thoughts and feelings that come with procrastination.

### So how can we support students to become more psychologically flexible?

Earlier in this piece I mentioned ACT - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - when defining psychological flexibility, so it may well be useful to look at how ACT can help out to foster psychological flexibility in our students (a good non-technical overview of ACT can be found [here][11]). ACT is about helping people to behave in ways that are "**open, aware, **and**engaged**". You don't need a formal course of therapy to put these skills into practice. Some quick exercises include:

* **Labelling thoughts (building openness)**: Notice a thought you've been struggling with, or that often shows up when you feel overwhelmed. This might be something like, 'I have way too much school work, I'll never get it done'. Now, do the following:

1. Distil the thought to just a few words. So, for the above thought, something like, 'too much to do'.
2. Now, put the thought inside the phrase, '_I'm having the thought that_...there's too much to do'.
3. Now, phrase the thought inside the phrase, '_I'm noticing I'm having the thought that_...there's too much to do'.
4. Get in touch with the experience of steps 1-3\. What was it like to experience this thought in 3 different ways?

* **Notice 5 things (building awareness)**: Pause. Take a few deep breaths, and do the following:

1. Notice 5 things you see in the room around you.
2. Notice 5 things you hear.
3. Notice 5 sensations you feel on the surface of your body.

* **Imagine your 60th birthday (building engagement):** Take a few moments to bring to your mind what your 60th birthday party might be like. Close your eyes if you wish. What do you see, smell, and hear at your party? Who is at your party? As the 60 year old you reflects on your life, what do they wish they spent less time worrying about? What do they wish you would have done differently? Doing this exercise can give you an idea about your values. You can then make **SMART** goals (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound) to move you in the direction of your values. Check out the video below for an easy to digest description of the difference between values and goals.

To summarise, ACT is not about trying to get rid of problems (and yes I know we in student affairs often like to be problem solvers). Instead ACT helps a person face the issues they are having with kindness, moving from being focused on solving problems to being focused on opening up to challenges and moving toward values.

[Exeter Uni][12] has an ACT based [program][13] based upon the work by Australian Uni [RMIT][14] and their audio e-learning program called [6 ACT Conversations][15].  
Exeter's programs aims to support students with the following:

* Overcoming procrastination and completing study tasks
* Starting and sustaining enjoyable relationships with your peers and friends
* Discovering your valued and meaningful life while studying at University
* Living a balanced and enjoyable life

These aims all flow back in to the themes of Unite's report and what we, as student affairs professionals, want for our students.

So to bring my first post to a close, I would like to say that the above are just a few tools I think we could be using to help students achieve their goals. Along with our students, we should acknowledge uni and adult life can be tough at times and that this is completely normal. Rather than fighting or avoiding these difficulties, we can be open about these with our students, help our students to face these challenges with compassion, and help them to continue to pursue goals that are important to them in their studies and life.
