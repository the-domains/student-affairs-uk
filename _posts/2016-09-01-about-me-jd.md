# About me, JD
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c4dbbefe-712f-41bd-9e04-fb1d0a303c34.png)

Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet.

You've obviously come to this page to find out who I am, so here's a little taster of little ol' me.

I'm a Scouse down south currently working at [Kingston University][0] as a Student Support Officer supporting students in the [Health, Social Care and Education][1] faculty (that's also linked with [St George's][2]).   
I've been in HE for over 12 years IT support (yes, switch it off and on again is always the answer) through to living on a site in a halls of residence supporting American study abroad students - mainly the importance of the letter U.

As well as being a good worker bee I am also a part-time student at Kingston studying an [MA in Research and Practice in Higher Education][3] and that has led to the creation of this blog.

When I'm not getting my Higher Ed nerdery on I enjoy travelling, exploring London, Crossfit and an unending search for poutine (that's what happens when you're in a relationship with a Canadian - ay, you know what I'm talking aboot!)  
So before this ends up sounding like a dating profile - although I do enjoy long walks on the beach - I'll end it there.  
If you would like to know more you can ...
