# Help seems to be the hardest word

Over my career I have probably sat down with hundreds, if not thousands of students offering support and guidance whilst at uni.   
Often they get to me because they've struggled on, never really asking for help and now it's just gotten too much. 

I've noticed something about a fair few of these students.They are really nice people, super helpful and seem, themselves great listeners. 

_Currently I support students training to be nurses, midwives, paramedics, social workers, teachers etc... They are going in to professions that need a person to be caring, empathetic and supportive. They are the type of people who will be there when you need them, ready to lend an ear or shoulder - pretty much they make amazing friends._

Now whilst they are a great listeners they all have something in common. They all suck at asking, particularly for help. I don't just see this in students but also people I've worked with and if I'm honest, myself.

Now, does this sound familiar to any one

**Friend**: "How are you?"

**Me**: "Fine thanks, how are you?" _\*\*\*secretly wishing inside I said at, the very least, "I'm meh!"\*\*\*_

**Friend**: "I'm okay"

**Me**: "Are you sure?"

Cue several hours of talking and and listening and maybe an ugly cry or two
