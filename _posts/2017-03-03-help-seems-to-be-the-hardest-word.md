# Help seems to be the hardest word

Over my career I have probably sat down with hundreds of students offering support and guidance whilst at uni.   
Often they get to me because they've struggled on, never really asking for help and now it's just gotten too much.

I've noticed something about a fair few of these students.They are really nice people, super helpful and seem, themselves great listeners.

_Currently I support students training to be nurses, midwives, paramedics, social workers, teachers etc... They are going in to professions that need a person to be caring, empathetic and supportive. They are the type of people who will be there when you need them, ready to lend an ear or shoulder - pretty much they make amazing friends._

Now whilst they are a great listeners they all have something in common. They all suck at asking, particularly for help. I don't just see this in students but also people I've worked with and if I'm honest, myself.

Now, does this sound familiar to any one

**Friend**: "How are you?"

**Me**: "Fine thanks, how are you?" _\*\*\*secretly wishing inside I said at, the very least, "I'm ... meh!"\*\*\*_

**Friend**: "I'm okay"

**Me**: "Are you sure?"

_Cue several hours of talking and and listening and maybe an ugly cry or two_

There seems to be something holding us back from saying "no, I'm not okay". We go in to the autopilot of saying "I'm fine" and deflect to trying to help others.

Why do we do this? As the helpers and supporters do we see it as being a weakness that we shouldn't need help? That we can't be very good at what we do if we have to ask for help.   
Maybe it is, or any other 100 reasons but we (students and staff) need to try and stop sometimes and say "I'm not okay" because that's okay.  
I'm going to try ,and I know I will fail a lot at trying to be truthful when a friend asks how things are. I just have to build up the courage to be honest.

Now for my students I need to let them know that it's fine to need help, no matter who you are or what you're studying. It's not a weakness but shows that you are human. And for my students, in the courses they are studying and the professions they are training to become, being human is your biggest strength.
