# Is empathy enough?

Over the past year I have embarked on masters in researching higher education and now it comes to the time to think about what my final project will be.  
I decided to research the experiences of Trans[\*][0] students within UK HE, mainly their experiences in student accommodation.

Now here's my question to myself:

> Should I even be researching this topic?

I ask this because I'm a cisgendered, white heterosexual male who has, relatively, had an easy life. I've never been discriminated against because of my colour, my gender or my sexuality. In the grand scheme of things I have it pretty damn good.

## Am I the right person to research this topic?

Working in student services and, hopefully, being a decent human being I think I'm pretty empathetic person.   
Students come to me seeking help and support and I do my best to provide that or at least get them going the right direction. Plus, I hope students of all backgrounds feel comfortable enough to come and see me whatever their issue.  
Research is a little different, students aren't seeking my help I'm seeking them.   
I'm not a part of the Trans\* community, or even the LGBT community.   
I may be considered an ally as I have friends, and friends of friends who are part of the communities and I am an advocate of equal and equitable rights for all. If I'm honest though that all feels a little tenuous.  
I can try and empathise with these communities but I may never truly understand the challenges they face.

So why would they want to help me with my research?

Along with empathy there also needs to be a sense of trust. The community that I want to engage with needs to trust why I'm doing this research, that it is not purely for personal gain (this all goes towards me getting my masters) but that I am also adding to the narrative and cause.

To build that trust I need to understand what my goals are of this research.   
For me, my goal is to focus the area of supporting Trans\* students in a UK HE context.   
Through working on my literature review I can see there is dearth of information on the experiences of Trans\* UK students. It is mostly focused on the experiences of students in the US - made even more prevalent over the past few years with the ever changing bathroom laws and more recently with the impending arrival [President Trump][1] (still finding it difficult to say those two words).

Having this research in a UK context feels very important for me and as highlighted in the NUS's 2014 report "[Education Beyond the Straight and Narrow][2]" University staff need to have a better understanding of Trans\* students and their needs.

That is one of my major goals and is something I value, especially as
