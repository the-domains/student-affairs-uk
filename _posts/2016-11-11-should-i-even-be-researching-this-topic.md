# Is empathy enough ?

Over the past year I have embarked on masters in researching higher education and now it comes to the time to think about what my final project will be.

I decided to research the experiences of Trans[\*][0] students within UK HE, mainly their experiences in student accommodation.

Now here's my question to myself:

### _Should I even be researching this topic?_

I ask this because I'm a cisgendered, white heterosexual male who has, relatively, had an easy life. I've never been discriminated against because of my colour, my gender or my sexuality. In the grand scheme of things I have it pretty damn good.

### Am I the right person to research this topic?

Working in student services and, hopefully, being a decent human being I think I'm pretty empathetic person.   
Students come to me seeking help and support and I do my best to provide that or at least get them going the right direction. Plus, I hope students of all backgrounds feel comfortable enough to come and see me whatever their issue.  
Research is a little different, students aren't seeking my help I'm seeking them.   
I'm not a part of the Trans\* community, or even the LGBT community.   
I may be considered an ally as I have friends, and friends of friends who are part of the communities and I am an advocate of equal and equitable rights for all. If I'm honest though that all feels a little tenuous.  
Maybe as [Eric Stoller][1] asks, should I be an activist?
![Should Admins Be Activists on Campus? {new post at @InsideHigherEd} https://t.co/xcwyGGMUjQ #SAchat](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3d0989dff3b1b3ece9c1d6e9a231a481/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=596&cropwidth=1572&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FCw5s7fhXEAI_Kxg.jpg%3Alarge&x=15&y=15)

Maybe I should, or maybe I already am, but that still doesn't change my thoughts of can I empathise with these communities? Because I may never truly understand the challenges they face.

### So what else do I need to do?

Along with empathy there also needs to be a sense of trust and engagement. The community that I want to engage with needs to trust why I'm doing this research, that it is not purely for personal gain (although this does all goes towards me getting my masters) but that I am also adding to the narrative and cause.

To build that trust I need to understand what my goals are of this research.   
For me, my goal is to focus the area of supporting Trans\* students in a UK HE context - so far in my research there doesn't seem to be much out there, and of what there is it is mainly focused in the US.  
Having this research in a UK context feels very important for me and as highlighted in the NUS's 2014 report "[Education Beyond the Straight and Narrow][2]" University staff need to have a better understanding of Trans\* students and their needs

Furthermore to my goals I also need to actively connect with the communities, sitting and reading about them is not going to be enough if I really want make an impact.

In writing this post it has helped me clarify some aspects of what I need to do, reflecting often helps with that.   
So to put my words in to action I have signed up for training with [Gendered Intelligence][3] for their course "[Introduction to Trans Awareness][4]".  
This is just a start and over the next few months on my research journey I will try and share my findings and experiences. Hopefully others will find it useful

If you have any questions or comments feel free to [tweet me][5].

Cheers
